JSP Lab

1.	Create an HTML page and jsp page using the jsp template in NetBeans. The HTML page should include a form.  The form should include two text boxes, a drop down menu and a submit button.  The first text box should be for a name and the second text box should be for a credit card number.  The drop down box should be an expiration year for the credit card (includes years from 2014 – 2020).  The jsp page should validate the credit card number (http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/515367/Validate-credit-card-number-with-Mod-algorithm). Create your own code. The jsp page should work for both ‘get’ and ‘post’ methods.  The jsp should display the person’s name, the last four digits of the credit card number, the expiration year and whether or not the credit card number was verified.
